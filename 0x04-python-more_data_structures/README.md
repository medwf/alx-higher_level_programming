## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and is designed to deepen your understanding of Python's data structures, specifically sets and dictionaries, and related concepts like lambda functions, map, reduce, and filter functions. You will gain valuable knowledge and experience in using these data structures effectively and understanding when to choose them over others like lists.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- The awesomeness of Python programming.
- Sets: what they are and how to use them.
- Common set methods and their applications.
- When to use sets versus lists.
- Iterating through a set.
- Dictionaries: what they are and how to use them.
- When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets.
- Understanding dictionary keys.
- Iterating over a dictionary.
- Lambda functions.
- Map, reduce, and filter functions.

### Man or Help

- `python3`

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Task mandatory

0. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
1. Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
2. Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
3. Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
4. Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
5. Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
6. Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
7. Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
8. Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
9. Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
10. Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
11. Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
12. echnical interview preparation:

    - You are not allowed to google anything
    - Whiteboard first
    - Create a function def roman_to_int(roman_string): that converts a Roman numeral to an integer
