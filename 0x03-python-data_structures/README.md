## Task mandatory

0. Write a function that prints all integers of a list. my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
1. Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
2. Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
3. Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
4. Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
5. Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
6. Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
7. Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
8. Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
9. Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
10. Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
11. Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list
12. Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
13. Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

    - Prototype: int is_palindrome(listint_t \*\*head);

## Task advanved

challenge : CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
Since we now know a bit of C, we can look at what is happening under the hood of Python. Let’s have fun with Python and C, and let’s look at what makes Python so easy to use.

     - Create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
     - Prototype: void print_python_list_info(PyObject \*p);
