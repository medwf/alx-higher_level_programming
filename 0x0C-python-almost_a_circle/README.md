# Python - Almost a circle

## Background Context

The AirBnB project is a significant part of the Higher Level curriculum. This project is designed to prepare you for it. In this project, you will review a wide range of Python concepts and also learn about various topics, including:

- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attributes
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unit testing
- Read/Write files

Additionally, you will also explore:

- `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Serialization and deserialization
- JSON
- Handling named arguments in functions

## Resources

Before diving into this project, you may want to read or watch the following resources:

- [args/kwargs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#arbitrary-argument-lists)
- [JSON encoder and decoder](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html)
- [unittest module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [Python test cheatsheet](https://github.com/trekhleb/homemade#-table-of-contents)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external references:

### General

- Understand what unit testing is and how to implement it in a large project.
- Know how to serialize and deserialize a class.
- Be able to read and write data in a JSON file.
- Understand the usage of `*args` and how to implement it in your code.
- Comprehend the concept of `**kwargs` and its practical applications.
- Know how to handle named arguments effectively within a function.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

Please keep in mind that copying and pasting someone else's work is strictly prohibited and goes against the spirit of this project. It's essential to develop solutions for the tasks independently to meet the learning objectives. Publishing any project content is not allowed, and plagiarism will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- You are allowed to use editors such as vi, vim, or emacs.
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5).
- Every file should end with a newline character.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A README.md file, located at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Your code should adhere to the pycodestyle (version 2.8.\*) guidelines.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using the `wc` command.
- All your modules, classes, and functions should be well-documented.

### Python Unit Tests

- You are allowed to use editors such as vi, vim, or emacs.
- All your test files should end with a newline character.
- All your test files should be placed inside a folder named `tests`.
- The `unittest` module should be used for your test cases.
- Test files should have the `.py` extension.
- All your test files and folders should start with `test_`.
- The organization of your test files should mirror the project's structure.
- You can run all your tests using the command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`.

We strongly encourage collaboration on test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage of edge cases.
